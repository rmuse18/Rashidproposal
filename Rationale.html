    <h1>Rationale
</h1>
    <p>The stigma behind receiving mental health help seems to be a sign of weakness many healthcare providers think, but how the stigma of receiving 
    professional help began is similar. 
    “The professional culture of the house of medicine not only mimics society in attributing stigma to people with mental health issues but may also 
    contribute to high rates of suicide in the ranks of health care professionals by leading to a delay in seeking treatment”(Kirk J. MD,1). 
    The stigma of receiving help for mental health was due to the spread of outlook on mental health patients. 
    The stigma has gone to where healthcare providers themselves do not want treatment because it is a sign of weakness and feebleness. 
    If healthcare providers do not seek help themselves how do they expect to deal with such agonizing environments such as the pandemic and still be 
    able to give patients the best care? Healthcare professionals need the help they can get because if not, they are not fit to provide help if they 
    cannot help themselves. In the heat of the pandemic healthcare providers have been overwhelmed with patients and thousands of deaths and as a result, 
    healthcare professionals have suffered greatly mentally and physically. The stigma of not receiving professional care has even more so affected the 
    strain of healthcare providers. I plan on researching more Claims of stigma in the healthcare profession about getting help and not being afraid of 
    the stigma. I hypothesize that the stigma of receiving professional help for mental health greatly affects the work healthcare providers perform. 
    This will show how my topic is very important and crucial to many people who need to understand the importance of mental health and seeking 
    help in general. If my hypothesis is disconfirmed, it will show lack of understanding but a different view on how healthcare providers feel in 
    their respected positions.</p>
