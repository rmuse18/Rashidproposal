    <h1>Methods and Designs
</h1>
    <p>I will use a qualitative approach to my research to gather my data in the healthcare field. This will allow me to have a better understanding 
    and a natural approach in the healthcare field. I would test numerous physicians and nurses on how they feel with a survey as well as for all 
    medical staff including janadors and receptionists. I would also like to include in the survey how staff perceive their coworkers and their stress 
    and see if it matches their answers with each other. I chose this sample because testing everyone in the hospital staff will get me the results of 
    finding who really needs some professional help, and with the perception of each coworker I can see the stigma behind the answers of each hospital 
    personnel. The stimuli would be how each coworker (without names) perceives each other based on how stressed and overwhelmed they are. 
    These stimuli would then give me more information on the reaction of each coworker and see if they really do want to get professional help. 
    I am going to present the stimuli on the lunch break of each coworker and ask them to complete the survey in a quiet room with myself not paying close 
    attention to the answers and just being there. I would analyze the results by comparing each survey answer to how their coworkers perceive them based 
    on stress and being overwhelmed. The hypothesis would be confirmed when each individual sees the comparison and proceeds for professional help. 
    But the disconfirmation of my hypothesis would be if the medical personnel would not proceed to get professional help (only if they do not need it).</p>
