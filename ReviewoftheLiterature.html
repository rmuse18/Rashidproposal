    <p>As Covid-19 continues to surge, doctors and care providers have been stressing and reporting burnouts due to overflow of Covid patients and deaths. 
    What has been known are the overlying stresses of being a care provider on top of the pandemic has proven to be extremely harsh to mental and physical well-being of healthcare providers. 
    Healthcare providers have been risking their mental and physical health as Covid patients keep arriving and some not to see their families again. 
    Research shows that healthcare providers have not been reaching out and receiving help for their mental health as Covid patients increase in the height of the pandemic. 
    In the field of healthcare, providers have been overwhelmed with countless patients that come through the door and go out into a hearse. 
    Covid patient death and care have taken an enormous toll on healthcare providers. 
    “It’s heartbreaking that you have people who are putting themselves at risk and facing enormous stress without getting the help they need.”(AAMC,1). 
    Healthcare Providers can not work in such mental and physical strain. Healthcare providers need to seek help in order to provide the best treatment to their patients. 
    “The pandemic is threatening the emotional well-being of thousands of providers. But fear of losing job opportunities, their peers' respect, and even their ability to practice medicine keeps many from seeking the care they need”(AAMC,1). 
    On top of overwhelming patient overflow’s, physicians have been urged to get the help they need in order to keep their respective job titles or face layoffs. 
    In the background of healthcare many insufficiency occurs such as: why is there stigma in finding help when emotionally stressed and how did the stigma even begin with?</p>
